              Hi! I’m Sabrina, a senior at ACP High School with a lifelong love for mathematics and problem-solving. I’ve competed in contests such as the AMCs and AIME and earned multiple recognitions, including being a 10-time recipient of the MAA Young Women in Mathematics Certificates of Excellence.
Math has been my passion since I was five, but being one of the few girls in competitive math often made me feel like every mistake defined me— not just as a student, but as a girl. Over time, I realized that my worth is not determined by stereotypes, but by my curiosity and persistence. That realization helped me grow into both a stronger problem-solver and a more confident person.
My background is what makes this mission so important to me. I started this chapter to create the kind of community I once wished for: a space where girls can take risks, make mistakes, learn, and celebrate their love for STEM together.
